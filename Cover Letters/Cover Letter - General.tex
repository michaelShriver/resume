Dear \resplaceholder{HIRING MANAGER},

\vspace{\baselineskip}

I am writing to apply for the \resplaceholder{JOB} position at \resplaceholder{COMPANY}. \resplaceholder{A BRIEF SENTENCE EXPRESSING SPECIFIC INTEREST IN THE COMPANY OR POSITION}. Over the last 14 years, I have grown my career from call center and desk side IT support roles to incident management and response. Most recently, though, I have held a Systems Analyst role where I have done extensive data analysis and reporting to all levels of leadership at my organization. The parts of my job I have most consistently enjoyed and excelled at have always been the parts that involve helping filter and illuminate data in order to facilitate informed decision making. I love helping partners and collaborators reach the "a ha" moment where data becomes knowledge and understanding.

In past jobs, I’ve showed an aptitude for using data to build processes that improve the efficiency and outcomes for my organization. At the Service Desk for Nordstrom, for instance, the company lacked a unified hardware asset management tool, so I maintained a PowerShell script that tracked the department’s workstations, laptops and other hardware. More recently, I was tasked with analyzing Incident and Problem Management data in order to provide the top leadership at the company with the information they needed to make critical business decisions for the IT organization. I created and maintained complex dynamic dashboards for executive assistants, so they could easily and quickly present Incident and Problem Management data to their executives. They found the resources I created to be invaluable timesavers. Finally, In my role as an Incident Manager, I worked closely with the developer team that rolled out our new ServiceNow ticketing system, helping collect and curate user stories, finalize designs, perform user testing, and collect feedback to make the final product something that worked for a wide variety of users' needs.  My passion in my day-to-day work life is building relationships with the people that I work with, and finding ways to collaboratively improve processes. I want to help people make better decisions. I believe these skills and experiences will allow me to be very successful at \resplaceholder{TEAM}.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

I am excited for the opportunity to grow my career and skills at \resplaceholder{COMPANY}. \resplaceholder{A BRIEF SENTENCE RELATING PERSONAL INTERESTS OR HOBBIES WITH THE POSITION}. I am eager for the next step of my career to be in alignment with my passions and values; I would love to know more about your team to see if it would be a good fit.

Thank you for considering me. I hope to hear from you soon.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Sincerely,
