Good day, Mike.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

I want to thank you for meeting with me a few weeks ago, and for opening up the opportunity for me to apply to the Service Desk Manager role. I know that the Service Desk can be a hectic place to work sometimes, and yet I found it to be rewarding in a lot of ways when I was working there. It is a place where it is easy to see your impact to the company, fellow employees and our customers. My vision for the team is a place where the analysts feel supported and respected, and feel that they share common goals with one another and with their leadership. I want to see the Service Desk as a place that not only provides excellent support to its direct customers, but that engages with the IT organization as a whole to help improve IT support processes from the top of the pyramid all the way down to the ‘Big C’ Customer.

As I mentioned earlier, I have heard positive things about the team and structure you are building right now. A friend who is currently working at the Service Desk suggested I look into applying, both because I would enjoy the work environment, and because I would be a good fit for the role. I believe that the Service Desk is  a good place to build a truly cohesive team that works together towards a common goal, and I believe that the best way to do that is to foster an environment where everyone feels supported and included. I will build this kind of team by being willing to listen to the input of my team and taking their concerns seriously, and I will take action on behalf of the team, and its members to further the goals of both.

My experience with the Incident Response Team, has helped me develop good working relationships with people all over the company, at all levels from IC to Director, Sr. Director and VP. I've watched closely the leaders that I respect most, and emulate their lead in my current job, and will continue to do that in this new role. My relationships will also help me build bridges between the Service Desk and other parts of the Technology organization that we will need as partners in order to drive the success of Service Desk goals and projects. Additionally, my experience at the Service Desk gives me a good perspective on the importance of the Service Desk's role, the common barriers faced by the team, and how vital it is to have a well-informed, friendly, and helpful first line of defense for IT issues.

Thanks for considering me for this role.
